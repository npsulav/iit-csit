# Classification of Computer
! Working Principal => Analog,Digital,Hybrid <br>
! Size => Super, mainframe,micro,mini <br>
! Brand => IBM,IBM Compatible, Apple <br>
! Model => XT,AT,PS/2 <br>

Hybrid => fast like analog, accurate as digital <br>

# Super
=> biggest and fastest <br>
=> process huge datas <br>
=> TIPS <br>
=> thousands of interconnected procressors <br> 

! password decrypt, animation rendering, flight simulations, diseases diagnosis <br>

# Mainframe
! hundreds of users <br>
! many process simultaneously <br>
! millions of transections per second<br>
! long life span ab. 50 yrs <br>
! large scale memory management <br>
! used as servers <br>

# Mini
! 4-200 users <br>
! midsized multiprocessing <br>
! billing, accounting <br>
! light weight, less expensive, fast, doesnot require controlled environment <br>

# Micro 
! Small sized <br>
! microprocessor as pocessor <br>
! Desktop, lappy <br>

# Computer System
it is a integration of input, memory and software to perform different activities <br>

! hardware => electric circuit and mechanical parts <br>

=> consist ALU,MU,CU <br>

# Functions
! read instructions from CPU <br>
! communicate with pheripherals <br>
! controls the sequence of instructions <br>
! controls the flow of data <br>

# ALU
! computing functions are performed <br>
! arithmetic(addn,subtract,multiply,divide) and logic(comparision) <br>

# CU
! provide timing and control signals to all operations <br>
! acts as superviser <br>
! controls and coordinate tasks  <br>
! control flow of data between CPU and Memory and memory and pheripherals <br>

# MU
! cache and primary memory <br>
! RAM and ROM => primary memory <br>

# Registers
! high speed temporary stortage <br>
! made from transistors and flipflops <br>
! high speed but least storage capacity <br>

# important registers in CPU
! Accumulator => contains result of arithmetic and logical operations <br>
! instruction =>most recently fetched instruction <br>
! memory address res => address of next location in memeory <br>
! program counter => address of next instruction <br>
! data reg => operations and other data <br>
! memory buffer register => temporarly stores data from memry or data to be sent to memory <br>

# Instruction Format
! 
!   [opcode,mode,address or operand]

# Instruction set
! a set of all basic operations that a processor can accomplish <br>
! LOAD A,0 <br>

# Instruction Cycle
! Fetching => processor fetches instruction form mrmory <br>
! Decoding => fetched instruction is broken into pieces <br>
! Executing => decoded instructions is executed <br>
! Storing => stored into memory <br>

# Microprocessor
! computer procesoor <br>
! multipurpose <br>
! clock driven <br>
! register based <br>
! digital integrated circuit <br>
! accept binary as input, process it and provides results <br>

# RISC and CISC

| RISC(focus on hardware)                             | CISC                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| simpler instructions                                | complex             |
| one word instruction                                | larger than 1 word  |
| instruction take single clock cycle to get executed | more than 1         |
| more registers                                      | less                |
| simple addressing mode                              | complex adress mode |
| less data type                                      | more                |
| pipeline can be achieved                            |  nah nah            |
